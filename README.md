# Agastya and Lopamudra for Extended Tamil
Agastya and Lopamudra are Unicode fonts for the Extended Tamil script, an experimental attempt to use the full complimentary set of Grantha letters to fill in the gaps in the Tamil script (as compared to the pan-Indic system).

Modern Tamil only adopts /ja/, /śa/, /ṣa/, /sa/, /ha/ and the compound /śrī/ from the Grantha script into its character reportoire. The missing aspirated/voiced Indic cognates are usually represented using superscript/subscript numerals e.g. பு³த்³த⁴போ³தி⁴ஸத்த்வேப்⁴ய꞉ /buddhabodhisattvebhyaḥ/. While this is easy to typeset and provides accurate transcription, the result is not visually pleasing (the text often resembling mathematical formulae) and also hard to read. The other drawback is that many readers tend to simply ignore the diacritics and read the text as it were normal Tamil.

Extended Tamil attempts to fix this by importing Grantha characters and using them as if they were Tamil characters. This was probably done instead of using superscript numerals (as done in the modern Times) to increase the readability of the text (and the possible wide-spread familiarity with Grantha script several decades ago). Apart from improving the visual aesthetics of the text and its readability, the imported consonants create a one-to-one visual binding with the phonemes that the reader cannot easily disregard.

This method was sporadically experimented from the late 1800's up until the middle part of the 20th century. One such publication from 1905 can be seen [here](https://archive.org/stream/bhojacharitrama00sastgoog#page/n534/mode/2up).
